#18.Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width and a method which will compute the area of a rectangle.

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def compute_area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

# Example Usage:
rectangle1 = Rectangle(5, 7)
area1 = rectangle1.compute_area()
print("Area of Rectangle 1:", area1)

rectangle2 = Rectangle(8, 10)
area2 = rectangle2.compute_area()
print("Area of Rectangle 2:", area2)
