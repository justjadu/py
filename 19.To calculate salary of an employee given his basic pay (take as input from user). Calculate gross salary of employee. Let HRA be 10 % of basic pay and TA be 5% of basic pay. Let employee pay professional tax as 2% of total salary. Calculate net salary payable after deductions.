#19.To calculate salary of an employee given his basic pay (take as input from user). Calculate gross salary of employee. Let HRA be 10 % of basic pay and TA be 5% of basic pay. Let employee pay professional tax as 2% of total salary. Calculate net salary payable after deductions.

basic_pay = float(input("Enter the basic pay: "))

# HRA is 10% of basic pay
hra = 0.1 * basic_pay

# TA is 5% of basic pay
ta = 0.05 * basic_pay

# Gross salary
gross_salary = basic_pay + hra + ta

# Professional tax is 2% of total salary
professional_tax = 0.02 * gross_salary

# Net salary after deductions
net_salary = gross_salary - professional_tax

print("Gross Salary:", gross_salary)
print("Net Salary after Deductions:", net_salary)
