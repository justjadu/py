#26.Write a program that reads an integer value n from the user, and then produces n lines of output. The first line contains 1 star, the second 2 stars, and so on until the last line, which should have n stars. Can you write this using only a single loop? Hint:
#Remember what the expression ‘+’*5 does.
#Enter a size: 5

#++
#+++
